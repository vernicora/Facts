# Outer Space Information for Kids

"Mom, why does the moon follow us wherever we go?"

"Dad, how big is the sun? How does it make light?"

Have you ever been asked these questions by your kids? Did you know how to answer? Explaining the concept of space, planets, stars, and the universe to young children can be challenging.

Here you are going to find some fun facts about space to share with your kids, along with some fun activities and songs to help them learn about outer space.

What's out there beyond the moon?

The moon orbits the earth. It seems to glow because the sun's rays are reflecting off of its surface. It seems to 'follow' us as we move and travel because we are moving a very small distance on Earth under a very large sky where the Moon makes its appearance.
The Earth is a planet, which is a body in space that orbits the sun and takes up a great amount of space. It takes the Earth 365 days to make a complete orbit around the sun. The Earth also rotates on an invisible axis. Every rotation takes 24 hours to complete. The rotations cause us to have day and night depending on what side of the Earth is facing the Sun.
There are eight planets: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Pluto was once considered a planet, but in 2006 it was decided that Pluto wasn't large enough to still be considered a planet like the others. It is now called a 'dwarf planet', just meaning that it is smaller than the others.
Our Sun, even though it seems quite large to us, is actually considered to be a medium sized star! That means there are suns and stars out there that are much larger. The light it produces is from the burning gases that make up the Sun, just like the other stars and suns out there. We benefit from the light and the heat it produces because the Earth is relatively close to the Sun.
The Sun is approximately 100 times larger than the Earth in width, but it is 1,300,000 times the size of the Earth in volume! To put it in perspective, it's like comparing a golf ball to the giant balls people bounce on during the show Wipe Out.
The high and low tides on Earth are caused by the gravitational pulls of the Sun and the Moon.
The first time anything made by humans touched outer space was in 1957 when Russia launched its first satellite Sputnik.
The first time a human touched the Moon was in 1969 when Neil Armstrong walked on the Moon. His footprints, and those of other astronauts, will be there forever because there is no wind on the Moon. The only way they can be wiped away is by another space body hitting the surface of the moon.

Famous Quote from the Lunar Landing
Neil Armstrong, when he became the first person to set foot on the Moon, said:

"That's one small step for [a] man, one giant leap for mankind."
